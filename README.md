# WishFull
WishFull is a web app I created as a project after the completion of MEAN stack at Coding Dojo.

The user can be a donor(who can donate to fulfill someone's wish) or a donee(needy people, foster home children, who enter their wishes). It can be used by corporates as a giving campaign app during Thanksgiving.
It is facebook login enabled and integrated with Paypal for donation.

It's a full stack development project based on MEAN- Mongo, Express, AngularJS and Node ad MVC architecture.
